This program is tested on MacOSX 10.15 Catalina and Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS(VBox) on my LAN.

When program first starts, it shows current IP address and you are required to type
An alias for yourself and then the program starts functioning.

If you want to go back from open message window, type "-back". Then you will be redirected
To the "Active Users" window.
